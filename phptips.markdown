# PHP Tips

# Creating strings

```
<?php
    echo "xxx" . "yyy";
?>

//Outputs xxxyyy

    echo 17 * 123;
//outputs 2091

//Create a variable with a $
    $myvariable = “string”;
    $number = 99;
//numbers dont need quotation marks

    echo $myvariable;
    echo $number;
//Outputs string 99
```

# Maths

```
//Compare and contrast numbers as you normally would
    echo 2 == 2;
    echo 2 > 1;
```

# if/else statements

```
$items =  10;   
// Set this to a number greater than 5!
          <?php
        $items = 3;

        if($items > 5) {
          echo "You get a 10% discount!";
        }
        else {
            echo "You get a 5% discount!";
        }
// Outputs You get a 10% discount!

//another example
        $foo = 7;
        if ($foo > 8) {
            echo "The condition is true";
        }
        else {
            echo "The condition is false";
        }
//outputs This condition is false
```

# elseif

```
    $foo = 3;
    if ($foo = 3) {
        echo "True!";
    }
    elseif ($foo > 3) {
        echo "Why?";   
    }
    else {
        echo "Nah!";
    }
```

//outputs True! //simple math stuff no biggie

# control switch

```
switch (2) {
    case 0:
        echo 'The value is 0';
        break;
    case 1:
        echo 'The value is 1';
        break;
    case 2:
        echo 'The value is 2';
        break;
    default:
        echo "The value isn't 0, 1 or 2";
}
```

//You can also switch syntax by using a variable like- $num = "2"; switch ($num) {...}

# Multiple Cases

```
$i = 5;
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        echo '$i is 0.';
        break;
    case 1:
    case 2:
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
        echo '$i is somewhere between 1 and 5.';
        break;
    case 6:
    case 7:
        echo '$i is either 6 or 7.';
        break;
    default:
        echo "I don't know how much \$i is.";
}
```

//outputs $i is somewhere between 1 and 5\. //always have the default so theres no error if something happens

# Arrays

//Simple array $array = array("Egg", "Tomato", "Beans"); //(echo $array[1]) or (echo $array{1};) to pick and choose from the array

//Change parts of the string $languages = array("HTML/CSS", "JavaScript", "PHP", "Python", "Ruby");

```
    $languages[1] = "GoLang";
    echo $languages[1];
```

//outputs GoLang

//Delete the whole array with unset($array);

//Delete part of the array with unset($array[2]);

# Change Variable

```
    foreach($languages as $lang) {
      print "<p>$lang</p>";
    }
```

//Changes variable name to something easier later in the script

# Loops

//Here's a for loop that echoes out all the years that have leap years for ($leap = 2004; $leap < 2050; $leap = $leap + 4) { echo "

$leap

"; } //Another Example from 10-100 for ($tens = 10; $leap <= 100; $leap = $leap + 10) { echo "

$tens

"; }

# ForEach

//An example ForEach loop //Loops + Arrays = ForEach $langs = array("JavaScript", "HTML/CSS", "PHP", "Python", "Ruby");

```
      foreach ($langs as $lang) {
          echo "<li>$lang</li>";
      }

      unset($lang);
```

//Another Example $sentence = array("I'm ", "learning ", "PHP!");

```
    foreach ($sentence as $word) {
      echo $word;
    }
```

//An example that puts it into use $yardlines = array("The 50... ", "the 40... ", "the 30... ", "the 20... ", "the 10... ");

```
    foreach ($yardlines as $yard) {
    echo $yard;
    }
    echo "touchdown!";
```

//Outputs The 50... the 40... the 30... the 20... the 10... touchdown!

# While Loops

```
//A while loop will execute as long as a certain condition is true. //An example page

<title>Coin Flips</title>

We are going to flip a coin until we get three heads in a row!

 <?php $headCount = 0; $flipCount = 0; while ($headCount < 3) { $flip = rand(0,1); $flipCount ++; if ($flip){ $headCount ++; echo "

//Outputs It took 8 flips!
