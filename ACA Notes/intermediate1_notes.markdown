# ACA Notes

### Prerequisites

We’re going to be going over the basic tools we’ll be using this semester.

- `The Command Line`, `terminal` or `CLI` (This is where we’ll do a lot our work in. Publishing our work, creating different versions of programs, Installing development libraries for out program, etc.)
- `Atom`
⋅⋅⋅The Atom Text Editor (or whatever editor you prefer). You can get it here: <https://atom.io/>
- `Git`
⋅⋅⋅Install and setup git in your terminal by following the steps here: <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/>
⋅⋅⋅If you don’t want to use git, you don’t have to, but I’ll be using it to add to my GitHub profile.
- `Node`
⋅⋅⋅This allows you to develop and test Javascript locally on your computer (ie Local Servers, building projects, etc.)
- `NPM`
⋅⋅⋅This is the package manager for node as well as Node’s tool-belt of sorts. With this you can tell node what to do, and download packages and Javascript Libraries to help make developing more streamlines and less of a headache. Most things Front-End development
